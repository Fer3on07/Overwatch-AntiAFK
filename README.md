# Overwatch 2 Anti-AFK Tool
## Automatically Keeps Your Accounts Active In-Game

This tool is designed to prevent your Overwatch 2 accounts from being flagged as AFK (Away From Keyboard) while in-game. By simulating movement, it ensures your characters remain active until you manually stop the application.
With this utility, your accounts will continue to move around the map, helping you stay in matches and avoid disconnections or inactivity penalties.

Note:
The current version provides basic movement functionality.
However, for improved realism and reduced detection, you can enhance the script by adding mouse movement (e.g., mousemove) to randomly change the point of view (POV) of each account.
This simulates more natural player behavior and can make the tool more effective.
